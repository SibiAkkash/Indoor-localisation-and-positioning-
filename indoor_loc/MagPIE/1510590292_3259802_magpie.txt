Description:
MagPIE is a publicly available dataset for the evaluation of indoor positioning algorithms that use magnetic anomalies. Our dataset contains IMU and magnetometer measurements along with ground truth position measurements that have centimeter-level accuracy. To produce this dataset, we collected over 13 hours of data (51 kilometers of total distance traveled) from three different buildings, with sensors both handheld and mounted on a wheeled robot, in environments with and without changes in the placement of objects that affect magnetometer measurements ("live loads'').
